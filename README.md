**Name:** Your name

**Matric No:** Your matric no

## Tips
1. CS3217's docs is at https://cs3217.netlify.com. Do visit the docs often, as
   it contains all things relevant to CS3217.
2. A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you
   to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. We opted in all rules and
   then slowly removed some rules we found unwieldy; as such, if you discover
   any rule that you think should be added/removed, do notify the teaching staff
   and we will consider changing it!

   In addition, keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline;
   some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
3. Do not burn out. Have fun!

## Written Answers

### Design Tradeoffs
> When you are designing your system, you will inevitably run into several
> possible implementations, in which you need to choose one among all. Please
> write at least 2 such scenarios and explain the trade-offs in the choices you
> are making. Afterwards, explain what choices you choose to implement and why.
>
> For example (might not happen to you -- this is just hypothetical!), when
> implementing a certain touch gesture, you might decide to use the method
> `foo` instead of `bar`. Explain what are the advantages and disadvantages of
> using `foo` and `bar`, and why you decided to go with `foo`.
